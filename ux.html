    <p>Background: A local flower shop, "Bloom & Petal," wants to enhance its online presence and increase sales by creating a new website. The company has an existing website that is outdated and doesn't provide a great user experience. Bloom & Petal is looking to create a modern, user-friendly website that will encourage customers to purchase flowers and other products online.</p>
<p>To gather information about Bloom & Petal's target audience, we conducted user interviews and analyzed website analytics. From this research, we learned that Bloom & Petal's primary customer base consists of women aged 25-45 who are looking to purchase flowers for special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries. They also sell flowers and plants for everyday occasions like office decor, housewarming gifts, and sympathy arrangements.</p>

    <p>Design:
After gathering the research, our team started working on the design of the new website. We decided to create a clean, modern design with a focus on high-quality images of flowers and arrangements. The color scheme was chosen to be soft pastel shades to create a calming and welcoming environment.
The home page features a prominent banner showcasing the latest promotions, new arrivals, and featured products. The navigation bar is easy to use, and it features categories such as "Flower Arrangements," "Plants," "Gifts & Accessories," and "Special Occasions." There is also a search bar to make it easier for users to find what they are looking for.
    <p>Product pages were designed to highlight the unique features of each arrangement and plant. High-quality images of the products are displayed prominently, along with details such as price, size, and delivery options. There is also a call-to-action button that directs the user to add the product to their cart.
</p>
<p>The checkout process was optimized to make it easy for customers to purchase products. The cart summary is visible on every page, and there are multiple payment options such as credit cards and PayPal. Customers can choose to create an account or checkout as a guest.</p>

</p>
  <p>Overall, the feedback was positive. Participants found the website easy to use, and they appreciated the high-quality images and detailed product information. Some minor issues were identified, such as confusing navigation and unclear delivery options. We made adjustments based on this feedback, and the final website was launched.
  <p>Results:
After launching the new website, Bloom & Petal saw an increase in online sales and revenue. The website's bounce rate decreased, and the average time spent on the site increased, indicating that customers were engaging more with the content. The review section received positive feedback, and the website received several glowing reviews from customers.
